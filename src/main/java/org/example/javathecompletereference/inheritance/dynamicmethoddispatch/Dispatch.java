    /*
    Method overriding forms the basis for
    one of Javaâ€™s most powerful concepts: dynamic method dispatch. Dynamic method dispatch
    is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time, rather
    than compile time. Dynamic method dispatch is important because this is how Java
    implements run-time polymorphism.

    /*
    a superclass reference variable can refer
    to a subclass object. Java uses this fact to resolve calls to overridden methods at run time.
