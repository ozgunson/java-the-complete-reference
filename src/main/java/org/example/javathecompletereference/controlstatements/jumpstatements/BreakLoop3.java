// break was not designed to provide the normal means by which a loop is terminated. The loopâ€™s
//conditional expression serves this purpose. The break statement should be used to cancel a loop only when
//some sort of special situation occurs

//    Here are two other points to remember about break. First, more than one break statement
//        may appear in a loop. However, be careful. Too many break statements have the tendency to
//        destructure your code. Second, the break that terminates a switch statement affects only that
//        switch statement and not any enclosing loops
