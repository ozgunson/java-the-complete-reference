    Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, they can be used to
    create object references, because Javaâ€™s approach to run-time polymorphism is implemented
    through the use of superclass references. Thus, it must be possible to create a reference to
    an abstract class so that it can be used to point to a subclass object.
